The delivery of this project should be a demo app how to get a generator-angular-fullstack generated application and (on top of the   generated app)    
   
 1. integrate (apply) https://bootswatch.com  
   
 and   
   
 2. implement http://meanjs.org/docs.html#menus. This is an AngularJS service that helps manage application menus. Look at the linked   code and implement the same capability in this demo (re-use all code which is applicable)  
   
 Change the generated "user profile" code such that it will save the user preferred theme also (https://bootswatch.com) - Through their  profile page users will be allowed to change/save their preferred theme. When users login the correct theme should be loaded.  
   
 The AngularJS service menu service will be tested to add / remove menus in the application menubar.  
   
 P.S - When generating the APP use sequelize / SQL3lite persistence. Generate the authentication boilerplate also   
 (with Google authentication). Change the generated user profile code to save also the user's theme. User's should be allowed to change their preferred bootswatch theme.
